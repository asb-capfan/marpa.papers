<h2>What are the advantages of Marpa?</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>It is available as a linkable library</p></li>
<li><p>It is written in C for speed</p></li>
<li><p>Marpa parses in times considered theoretically optimal</p></li>
<li><p>Your grammar can be described in an extended version of BNF</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This means you provide the rules as text, not as code. Marpa provides the code to implement these rules.</p>

<p>Rules have an optional action adverb, indicating where Marpa is to trigger your callback to handle intermediate results.</p>

<p>This provides an exceptionally clean interface between the rules and any code you need to handle specific cases.</p>

<p>This Marpa-specific BNF is called SLIF DSL (Scanless Interface Domain-Specific Language).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Marpa parses all classes of grammar in practical use today in linear time, O(n)</p></li>
<li><p>Marpa lexes the token stream</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This means you do not have to provide a separate lexer.</p>

<ul>
<li>Marpa is extensively documented</li>
</ul>

<p>And, the author has a <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/">Marpa-oriented blog</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Marpa can effortlessly pause and resume parsing at any place in the token stream</li>
</ul>

<p>Rules have an optional pause adverb, indicating where Marpa is to return to your calling code, until such time as you
call resume().</p>

<p>During the pause, a set of methods allows you to interrogate Marpa about the current state of the parse.</p>

<p>It also means you can parse the next part of the token stream yourself, and tell Marpa to skip what you've handled.</p>

<ul>
<li>Following on from the previous point, error reporting can provide the precise location of an error</li>
</ul>

<p>This means the string just preceeding and just following the error can be retrieved, as well as a list of the tokens
Marpa was expecting to see at that point.</p>

<p>Even better, Marpa can tell you which rule(s) it was evaluating.</p>

<ul>
<li>Following on, again: Marpa allows you to fabricate input knowing what Marpa was expecting when it errored</li>
</ul>

<p>This is call Ruby Slippers parsing.</p>

<p><a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2011/11/marpa-and-the-ruby-slippers.html">See this article</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Marpa supports grammars having nullable symbols</p></li>
<li><p>Rules can be (indirectly) recursive</p></li>
<li><p>Grammars can be ambiguous</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This means Marpa can tell you how many different ways there are of interpreting the token stream.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rules can have events</li>
</ul>

<p>The current status of each event can be interrogated by your code during a pause.</p>

<p>Events can be activated and deactivated.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Marpa has built-in tracing facilities</p></li>
<li><p>Marpa has a 'thin' interface, for direct access to libmarpa</p></li>
<li><p>Marpa changes the way we think about parsing</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This automatically leads us to redefine what problems fit the definition of 'parseable'.</p>
