<h1>FAQ</h1>

<p><a href="index.html">Index</a></p>

<h2>What is the meaning of G0 and G1?</h2>

<p>G0 defines exactly what tokens are acceptable in the input stream. So, these are the rules defining the
syntax of the tokens, but not the syntax of how these tokens can be combined.</p>

<p>G1 defines the structure of the language. These rules define legal statements within the given language.
Legal statements are thus legal combinations of tokens.</p>

<p>Also, G1 rules have a semantics, whereas G0 rules do not.</p>

<p>G0 and G1 discussed in <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::Scanless::DSL">Marpa::R2::Scanless::DSL</a>, and, very
briefly, in <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::Semantics">Marpa::R2::Semantics</a>. In both cases, search for 'G0'.</p>

<h2>How do I parse numbers?</h2>

<p>Chapter 2 of <a href="http://marpa-guide.github.io/">Peter Stuifzand's Marpa Guide</a> discusses this issue at length
And if you fork that project on github, you'll find the directory examples/ contains about a dozen sample programs.</p>

<p>Alternately, download <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/MarpaX-Languages-SVG-Parser">MarpaX::Languages::SVG::Parser</a>,
which contains similar logic (in data/*.bnf). Further, this latter distro includes sample code (float.pl and number.pl)
in the scripts/ directory. The last-named script includes grammars for binary, octal and hex numbers which I did
not need in the SVG parser.</p>

<h2>How do I represent choice in the grammar?</h2>

<p>Briefly, use '|'. Sample code from the above named module (data/d.bnf):</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>coordinate  ::= float      action =&gt; float
                | integer  action =&gt; integer
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that '||' is available to control the relative priorities of the alternatives.</p>

<p>This issue is expanded upon in the next 2 items in this FAQ.</p>

<h2>Is there any other way of representing choice?</h2>

<p>Sure. Consider these G0 rules (also from data/d.bnf):</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>sign_maybe  ~ [+-]
sign_maybe  ~

digit       ~ [0-9]
digit_any   ~ digit*
digit_many  ~ digit+

E           ~ [Ee] sign_maybe digit_many
E_maybe     ~ E
E_maybe     ~

:lexeme     ~ float
float       ~ sign_maybe digit_many E
              | sign_maybe digit_any '.' digit_many E_maybe
              | sign_maybe digit_many '.' E_maybe
              | sign_maybe non_zero digit_any
</code></pre>

<p>This is saying:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The sign is optional after E or e (sign_maybe)</p></li>
<li><p>The E is optional (E_maybe)</p></li>
<li><p>The sign is optional before a digit (the first alternative for 'float')</p></li>
<li><p>And so on</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>What's the difference between '|' and '||' in grammar definitions?</h2>

<p>'|' expresses a simple alternative, while '||' separates alternatives at different levels of precedence. For example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>E ::=    E '*' E
      |  E '/' E
      || E '+' E
      |  E '-' E
</code></pre>

<p>This describes syntax for a simple 4-operation calculator, where multiplication and division take precedence over
addition and subtraction.</p>

<p>This construct forces alternatives before the '||' to have higher precedence than the alternatives after that token.</p>

<p>Each of the alternatives separated by '|' are at the same precedence.</p>

<p>In Mark Dominus's 'Higher-Order Perl' book, he describes how he handles precedence in his recursive descent parsers
for a similar calculator, beginning on p. 394. This is a good description of how the same situation would be handled
with pre-Marpa techniques.</p>

<p>If precedence is not an issue for you, just use single bar alternation ('|').</p>

<p>Note also that Marpa supports a 'priority' adverb, discussed in the
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::Scanless::DSL">Marpa::R2::Scanless::DSL</a> docs mentioned above.</p>

<h2>What does it mean to hide (mask) tokens?</h2>

<p>It's possible to design a grammar such that we can say certain tokens are hidden. This is discussed under
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::Scanless::DSL#RHS-alternatives">RHS-alternatives in Marpa::R2::Scanless::DSL</a>.</p>

<p>Here is an example (from <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Graph::Easy::Marpa::Parser">Graph::Easy::Marpa::Parser</a>):</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>node_definition  ::= node_statement
                 | node_statement graph_definition

node_statement   ::= node_name
                 | node_name attribute_definition
                 | node_statement (',') node_statement

node_name        ::= start_node end_node

:lexeme          ~ start_node  pause =&gt; before  event =&gt; start_node
start_node       ~ '['

:lexeme          ~ end_node
end_node         ~ ']'
</code></pre>

<p>The comma is hidden. But what does this mean, exactly?</p>

<p>It means the comma may appear in the input stream (in this context), but I am not interested in it. So, Marpa will not
return this token to me when an action is called. It has become invisible to the semantics.</p>

<p>Semantics are documented in <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::Semantics">Marpa::R2::Semantics</a>.</p>

<p>Close study of the above grammar will show that another path is possible thru the grammar, in the case of
2 nodes side-by-side (i.e. without a comma between them). Thus the grammar accepts both these input streams
as valid:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>Stream 1: [node.a], [node.b]
Stream 2: [node.a]  [node.b]
</code></pre>

<p>Hence, from the end-user's viewpoint, the comma is defined - at least in this particular grammar - to be optional.</p>

<h2>How do I implement recursion in a grammar?</h2>

<p>See the next item.</p>

<h2>Why does using '+' or '*' in a rule only work sometimes?</h2>

<p>I assume you're referring to cases like this:</p>

<p>Case 1 (fails):</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>node_definition  ::= node_statement+
                 | node_statement graph_definition
</code></pre>

<p>Case 2 (succeeds):</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>coordinate_list  ::= coordinate+
</code></pre>

<p>Case 3 (succeeds):</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>whitespace       ~ [\s]+
</code></pre>

<p>Briefly, quantified rules (here, using the '+'), are only allowed when the right-hand side contains a single
alternative. Thus case 1 fails due to the combination of '+' and '|'.</p>

<p>This is documented under <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::Scanless::DSL#Quantified-rules">#Quantified-rules in Marpa::R2::Scanless::DSL</a>.</p>

<p>So we must re-write rule 1 (with some context):</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>graph_definition  ::= node_definition
                  | edge_definition
                  | subgraph_definition

node_definition  ::= node_statement
                 | node_statement graph_definition

node_statement   ::= node_name
                 | node_name attribute_definition
                 | node_statement (',') node_statement
</code></pre>

<p>Now the rule 'node_definition ::= node_statement' allows a node definition to consist of a single node statement.</p>

<p>And the alternative (via the '|') 'node_definition ::= node_statement graph_definition' allows a node
definition to consist of a node statement followed by a graph definition, which just happens to include the line
'graph_definition ::= node_definition'!</p>

<p>So we've managed to write the grammar using indirect recursion, thus allowing an indefinite list of node
definitions to follow one another. And the last rule allows the input stream to separate them with commas as
well as the usual spaces.</p>

<h2>How do I find out where I am within the input stream?</h2>

<p>See <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::Scanless::R#line_column()">the line_column() method in Marpa::R2::Scanless::R</a>.</p>

<h2>How do I find out which rule applies at some point in the input stream (e.g. during a pause)?</h2>

<p>See under <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::Semantics#Action-context">Action-context in Marpa::R2::Semantics</a>,
for access to internal variables in Marpa which do what you want.</p>

<h2>What is the meaning of the line number in a Marpa error message?</h2>

<p>It is the line number within the BNF of the rule being processed.</p>

<p>Note: If your grammar uses \r, that will affect the line count.</p>

<p>Further, see <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::Scanless::R#line_column()">the line_column() method in Marpa::R2::Scanless::R</a>
for various special characters some of which may affect this line count.</p>

<h2>How do I implement disambiguation logic?</h2>

<p>In the docs for <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::Semantics">Marpa::R2::Semantics</a>, the section titled
'Bailing out of parse evaluation' discusses how to short-circuit semantic analysis.</p>

<p>See also <a href="https://gist.github.com/dginev/6419166">this gist</a>.</p>

<h2>Where is Ruby Slippers parsing documented?</h2>

<p>Start with <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::Recognizer#Ruby-Slippers-parsing">Marpa::R2::Semantics</a>.
This document has several references to Ruby Slippers.</p>

<p>See also <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2011/11/marpa-and-the-ruby-slippers.html">Ruby Slippers parsing</a>.</p>

<h2>How do I associate an action class with my grammar?</h2>

<p>Note: The next FAQ item, 'Declaring an Action Class', details a solution to the problems discussed here.</p>

<p>The synopsis in <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::Semantics">Marpa::R2::Semantics</a> shows one way to use
action classes. See 'bless_package'.</p>

<p>Another way is to note that the Scanless recognizer's constructor accepts a 'semantics_package' argument. See
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::Scanless::R">Marpa::R2::Scanless::R</a>.</p>

<p>Here's how I declare a recognizer in one package:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>$self -&gt; recce
(
    Marpa::R2::Scanless::R -&gt; new
    ({
        grammar           =&gt; $self -&gt; grammar,
        semantics_package =&gt; 'MarpaX::Languages::SVG::Parser::Actions',
    })
);
</code></pre>

<p>Now actions referenced in the grammar, as in:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>coordinate  ::= float      action =&gt; float
                | integer  action =&gt; integer
</code></pre>

<p>must be declared as functions in the named semantics package, because that's where Marpa looks for them.</p>

<p>From an OO point of view though, there is still a problem. After reading 'The per-parse argument' and
'The per-parse constructor' sections of the semantics document, you might think:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>Marpa calls the constructor of the semantics package (given it has one).
That means Marpa has an instance of that package.
That should mean I can get access to that instance.
So, my program can communicate between the main-line code, Marpa and this instance.
</code></pre>

<p>This immediately raises some questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I access that instance?</li>
</ul>

<p>Under Marpa::R2, you can't.</p>

<ul>
<li>If I use Moo to write this action package, what happens?</li>
</ul>

<p>Presumably you want an instance of the action class to be passed by Marpa as the per-parse (1st) parameter to each
action sub. That's certainly what I've always wanted to do. But...</p>

<p>Don't do that. It works, but turns out to be inherently risky, so don't try it. Alternatives are discussed in the
next FAQ item: 'Declaring an Action Class'.</p>

<p>The problem here is that with <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Moo">Moo</a>, the new() constructor is generated automatically.
My tests show such a instance is not initialized by Marpa. That is, Marpa cannot find new(), and passes an
unblessed hash into each action sub, as the per-parse (1st) parameter. In short, Moo patches Perl's symbol table, and
Marpa accesses the symbol table  too, but they don't co-operate as you might hope.</p>

<ul>
<li>If I create an instance of the action class, can I pass it to Marpa?</li>
</ul>

<p>Under Marpa::R2, no, you can't.</p>

<ul>
<li>But which instance is Marpa using?</li>
</ul>

<p>It's own.</p>

<ul>
<li>If my action subs accumulate instance-level data, how can I retrieve such data?</li>
</ul>

<p>(This means, data generated when Marpa calls action subs within its own copy of this instance.)</p>

<p>I don't know, but it 'just works' (with Moo at least). I used to use this code:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>$self -&gt; actions
(
    MarpaX::Languages::SVG::Parser::Actions -&gt; new(logger =&gt; $self -&gt; logger)
);
</code></pre>

<p>along with the initialization of $self -> recce(...) above.</p>

<p>Actually, it can work if both instances use global variables within the class. So...</p>

<p>Later, when I used $self -> action to access data within my instance, I got the data generated in the calls by Marpa
to my action subs. So, it works.</p>

<p>However, it seems like it works accidently, and I feel deeply uneasy about that. And, worse, it could suddenly stop
working when any of Perl, Moo or Marpa change internally.</p>

<ul>
<li>Well, can I use global variables within the action class to gather data generated by action subs?</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, but if they are class-level variables, it means you can't run multiple scripts at the same which use that class.
That's a classic problem with global data. The other problem of course is re-initializing the data before the second
run of the same script, or before the first run of any other script. It's ok if you re-run Perl itself, via the
command line say, when you run the next script. But in a persistent environment you won't be doing that. Hence, the
next item in this FAQ.</p>

<h2>Declaring an Action Class</h2>

<p>The previous item in this FAQ discussed at length various issues regarding how to cleanly generate data within action
subs, and how to pass that data back to the main-line code which called Marpa.</p>

<p>Here I explain the standard solution as used in a module,
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/MarpaX-Languages-SVG-Parser">MarpaX::Languages::SVG::Parser</a>, on CPAN. Briefly:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each action sub returns a <em>hashref</em> to Marpa</li>
</ul>

<p>This is because Marpa is the one calling the subs and gathering the results. And the hashrefs of course suit my code,
whereas you may prefer to use a different data structure.</p>

<ul>
<li>After a successful parse, the result of the parse is processed to recover those hashrefs</li>
</ul>

<p>This result is returned by the value() method of the recognizer class.
See <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::Scanless::R">Marpa::R2::Scanless::R</a>.</p>

<p>There is one basic problem to solve along the way: The data structure Marpa makes available as the result of the parse
can be a deeply nested set of <em>arrayrefs</em>, depending on how deeply within the grammar the action sub is named.</p>

<p>So, we have to unravel the <em>arrayrefs</em> to recover the <em>hashrefs</em>.</p>

<p>Conside this fragment of the SVG grammar from
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/MarpaX-Languages-SVG-Parser">MarpaX::Languages::SVG::Parser</a>:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>curve_to            ::= Cc curve_to_arguments  action =&gt; command

curve_to_arguments  ::= coordinate_triple
                        | coordinate_triple curve_to_arguments
...
coordinate_triple   ::= coordinate coordinate coordinate
...
coordinate          ::= float  action =&gt; float
...
Cc                  ~ [Cc]
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, given a curve - say the string 'C 10,11 20,21 30,31' - Marpa will call both <em>float()</em> and <em>command()</em>.</p>

<p>(Elsewhere the grammar says commas are to be discarded).</p>

<p>What happens in practice? Firstly, the code:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>sub command
{
    my($hashref, $t1, @t2) = @_;
    $param_count = 0;

    return
    {
        count =&gt; ++$item_count,
        name  =&gt; $t1,
        type  =&gt; 'command',
        value =&gt; [@t2],
    };

} # End of command.

# -----------------

sub float
{
    my($hashref, $t1) = @_;

    return
    {
        count =&gt; ++$item_count,
        name  =&gt; ++$param_count,
        type  =&gt; 'float',
        value =&gt; $t1,
    };

} # End of float.
</code></pre>

<p>Things to note:</p>

<ul>
<li>We don't count the floats, to ensure there are 6, or 8, ...</li>
</ul>

<p>This is because the input stream is deemed to have been validatated as being SVG.</p>

<ul>
<li>A global variable counts output hashrefs</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly this has a problem with the global variable issue just discussed, but I'm ignoring that here. And anyway,
we can easily renumber the hashrefs later.</p>

<ul>
<li>A global variable counts parameters per command</li>
</ul>

<p>This has the same problem, but the docs for the module do say the value is just a convenience for the caller.
Nevertheless, it's vital to keep such issues in mind.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>float()</em> is called for every number</li>
</ul>

<p>This includes the fact that the grammar says there are at least 3 coordinates (float pairs) per <em>curve</em> command.</p>

<p>This is not a problem, just a fact. We handle it with a Perl array, as explained next.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>command()</em> is called at the end of the string</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, this is not a problem. On the contrary - it is an inescapable part of the solution!</p>

<p>But it does mean that we need to be aware of what Marpa does with the results of calling <em>float()</em>, i.e. where
are they, when Marpa calls <em>command()</em>.</p>

<p>It is simple. The results of the 6+ (in this grammar) calls to <em>float()</em>, 6+ <em>hashrefs</em>, are passed as the trailing
parameters in the call to   <em>command()</em>. That explains the @t2 parameter in the first line of <em>command()</em>.</p>

<p>Likewise, we can say that since, in the grammar, nothing is subservient to <em>float</em>, then no action subs can possibly
be called in the processing of a float. So, when <em>float()</em> is called, it <em>cannot have</em> any such trailing parameters.</p>

<p>Where does this leave us? It means that the @t2 parameter to <em>command()</em> contains a set of 6+ floats packaged as
<em>hahsrefs</em> inside an unknown number of <em>arrayrefs</em>.</p>

<p>The same logic applies to the output of <em>command()</em> within the context of the output of parsing the whole input stream.</p>

<p>Our final task then will be to recover the result of the parse and unravel and discard the <em>arrayrefs</em>. This will
leave us with a set of <em>hashrefs</em>, which was the point of the exercise. I should repeat: This structure suits my
purpose. Adapt as required.</p>

<p>The remainder of the code:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>my($result) = $self -&gt; recce -&gt; value;

die "Marpa's parse failed\n" if (! defined $result);

# Unravel whatever Marpa gives us.

for my $item (@{$self -&gt; decode_result($$result)})
{
    # If it's a command, unravel the 'value =&gt; [@t2]' component.

    if ($$item{type} eq 'command')
    {
        $self -&gt; new_item($$item{type}, $$item{name}, '-');

        for my $param (@{$self -&gt; decode_result($$item{value})})
        {
            $self -&gt; new_item($$param{type}, $$param{name}, $$param{value});
        }
    }
    else
    {
        $self -&gt; new_item($$item{type}, $$item{name}, $$item{value});
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, the workhorse sub:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>sub decode_result
{
    my($self, $result) = @_;
    my(@worklist) = $result;

    my($obj);
    my($ref_type);
    my(@stack);

    do
    {
        $obj      = shift @worklist;
        $ref_type = ref $obj;

        if ($ref_type eq 'ARRAY')
        {
            unshift @worklist, @$obj; # Unravel Marpa's handiwork.
        }
        elsif ($ref_type eq 'HASH')
        {
            push @stack, {%$obj}; # Build array of results.
        }
        else
        {
            die "Unsupported object type $ref_type\n" if ($ref_type);
        }
    } while (@worklist);

    return [@stack]; # Return an arrayref of hashrefs.

} # End of decode_result.
</code></pre>
